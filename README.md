# ProofMe-Canva
When design â™¥ feedback on a Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension
##Requires ProofMe@`v0.1259.284-release+ `

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LrEVVCoEHrjNL5DV06xxT_V5QuqObcwiluQJTNjNhcqoaON_1nICCv0j7dsgHX8RaooGVjZEvg=s1280-h800-e365-rw">
###Features
Add two buttons to canva's "Share" and "Download" menu.

Also add a "Open Proof" button if proof exists*, including a tooltip if there are comments.

When exporting a canva design to ProofMe, if proof exists*, we create a new file version. If not create we a new proof.

When Canva provides a zip file of images, where each image is one page of the design, ProofMe will still treat them as a single file model, and set download link to original zip file.

On exporting success, able to open proof, open proof at edit panel, due date or add reviewers.


Browser icon open dropdown.

`proof exists*`: the same ProofMe user already has a proof with the same canva design

Initial Specs: https://proofme.com/p/6hnmackbc4rp8pg/Canva-Chrome-Plugin?files

The extension will talk to production `proofme.com` by default right now.

####Reversing Canva
Get token:

```
$.ajax({
      url: "/_ajax/csrf/export",
      method: "GET",
       dataType: "text"
    })
```
Get current design's version:

```
function exportPDF (token, docId, pages, 1)
// expect request to fail, unless it's indeed first version
// find correct version number in error message
function exportPDF (token, docId, pages, docVersion)
```

try {

Start export task


```
// This ajax will make canva start exporing task
$.ajax({
          url: "/_ajax/export",
          headers: {
              'content-type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8',
              'x-csrf-token': token
          },
          method: "POST",
          data: JSON.stringify({"attachment":true,"docId":docId,"docVersion":docVersion,"spec":{"mediaDpi":300,"mediaQuality":"SCREEN","bleed":false,"crops":false,"removeCanvas":false,"pages": pages,"targetImageSizeKb":null,"format":"PDF","type":"SCREEN"}}),
          dataType: "text"
        });
```

Get exported PDF Url

```
function getPDFUrl(id, token)

keep making this ajax until Canva finishes PDF export


$.ajax({
      url: `/_ajax/export/${id}`,
      data: {"attachment": "true"},
      headers: {
          'content-type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8',
          'x-csrf-token': token
      },
      method: "GET",
      dataType: "text"
    });



```

} catch (version is update at the very moment) {
	fall back to `Get current design's version` step
}
